# Mini-Legate Conductor Template

This directory ships the prompt that turns an [agent-deck](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck) **conductor** into a per-repo **Legate** — a Claude Code session that drives the Smithy plan→implement→PR→fix loop on a single repository.

`CLAUDE.md` is the conductor's identity prompt. It is rendered with the values of the target repository by `march legate init` (see [`src/legate.ts`](../../legate.ts)) into `~/.march/legate/<conductor-name>/CLAUDE.md`, then `agent-deck conductor setup --claude-md <path>` symlinks the conductor's own `CLAUDE.md` to that file. Editing the rendered template and restarting the conductor is the operator's iteration loop.

This README is **not** rendered or deployed — it stays here as developer-facing documentation of what the prompt is meant to do.

## What mini-legate is

Mini-legate is a precursor to the full Legate component described in March RFC `2026-001-march-orchestration-platform` (Milestone 5). It exists ahead of the M1–M4 infrastructure (Spawn, Hatchery, Brood, Herald) because Claude Code auto mode is reliable enough to handle most of Legate's reasoning today. It runs entirely on top of:

- `agent-deck conductor` for runtime, parent/child links, heartbeats, transition notifications.
- `smithy` CLI and skills for "what work to pick up next".
- `gh` CLI for high-level PR state.
- The `smithy.pr-review` skill for unresolved inline review threads.

There is no host-side spawn sandbox, no declarative profile system, no separate event bus, and no persistent session manager — those arrive with M1–M4. Mini-legate's interface to those concerns is whatever agent-deck provides today.

## Slice State Machine

Each Smithy slice the conductor picks up moves through this state machine. Triggers in italics; terminal states in **bold**.

### State definitions (mirrors `state.json`)

| Stage           | Meaning                                                                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `planning`      | Slice is being scoped via `/smithy.cut` etc., no PR yet.                                          |
| `implementing`  | Worker is running `/smithy.forge` (or equivalent) in its own worktree; no PR open yet.            |
| `pr-open`       | PR has been opened by the worker. CI/reviews are running. No unresolved inline threads detected. |
| `pr-in-fix`     | A `/smithy.fix` has been dispatched in response to CI failure or review feedback.                |
| `merged`        | PR is `MERGED`. Worktree is left on disk for operator cleanup until Brood (M3) ships.            |
| `escalated`     | Conductor has surfaced a `NEED:` to the operator; legate will not act on this slice until cleared.|

### What drives transitions

| Trigger                                       | Source                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Worker `running → waiting | error | idle`     | agent-deck transition notifier (`agent-deck notify-daemon`, PR #580) |
| Periodic re-scan of all workers + PRs         | agent-deck heartbeat (`[HEARTBEAT]` messages from the bridge)       |
| Operator instruction                          | Telegram/Slack message via the conductor bridge, or direct attach   |
| New commit on PR / CI completion / new review | discovered via `gh pr ...` during a heartbeat or transition wake-up |

The conductor never polls on its own schedule — heartbeats and transition notifications are the only timers.

## What's deployed and where

`march legate init` (run from inside a repo) does the following:

1. Detect repo basename → derive defaults: profile = repo slug, conductor name = `legate-<slug>`, worker group = `legate-workers`.
2. Render `src/templates/legate/CLAUDE.md` with `{REPO_NAME}` / `{REPO_PATH}` / `{PROFILE}` / `{CONDUCTOR_NAME}` / `{WORKER_GROUP}` substitutions.
3. Stage the rendered template at `~/.march/legate/<conductor-name>/CLAUDE.md` (stable, march-owned path).
4. Run `agent-deck -p <profile> conductor setup <name> -description "..." -claude-md <staged path>`. agent-deck symlinks the conductor's own `CLAUDE.md` to the staged file, registers the conductor session, and starts it.
5. `agent-deck session set conductor-<name> auto-mode true` to put the conductor into Claude Code's `--permission-mode auto`, then `agent-deck session set conductor-<name> extra-args -- --model <model>` to pin the model (default: `sonnet`; override with `march legate init --model <id>`), then `session restart` so both flags take effect immediately. The conductor's role is orchestration-heavy / reasoning-light — Sonnet is intentionally chosen as the default; workers stay on the Claude default for real implementation work.
6. (Linux/WSL2) `systemctl --user start agent-deck-conductor-bridge` and verify with `systemctl --user is-active --quiet agent-deck-conductor-bridge`. agent-deck installs and tries to enable+start this systemd unit during conductor setup, but a successful unit install does not guarantee a healthy daemon — `march legate init` re-asserts the start and verifies, so a crash-loop (e.g. a Python 3.8 host trying to run a bridge.py that uses Python 3.9 generics) is surfaced immediately rather than silently leaving the conductor inert.

After that, editing `~/.march/legate/<conductor-name>/CLAUDE.md` (or re-running `march legate init` after editing the source template) and `agent-deck session restart conductor-<name>` is the iteration loop.

### Why bridge-start matters

The conductor's only autonomous trigger is `[HEARTBEAT]` messages. The agent-deck bridge daemon (`~/.agent-deck/conductor/bridge.py`, run as `agent-deck-conductor-bridge.service` on Linux/WSL2 or `com.agentdeck.conductor-bridge` launchd plist on macOS) is what generates those messages on a configurable cadence (default 15 min) and forwards them into the conductor's tmux session via `agent-deck session send`. With the bridge stopped, the conductor sits in `waiting` indefinitely — healthy but inert. Manual `agent-deck session send` is the fallback.

**Python version requirement (host-level):** agent-deck's `bridge.py` uses PEP 585 generic builtins (`list[dict]`, `dict[str, Any]`), which require Python 3.9 or newer. On hosts whose default `python3` is 3.8 or older (Ubuntu 20.04 / WSL2's stock image, for example), the bridge will crash on import and systemd will retry until it gives up, even though the unit shows as "loaded". `march legate init` will surface this as a `Bridge daemon: NOT active` warning with the log path so the operator can either install Python 3.9+ or fall back to manual heartbeats.

## Permission mode — how it's wired

agent-deck only exposes the `auto_mode` key on the global `[claude]` block (see `internal/session/userconfig.go:653`). `[groups.<name>.claude]` and `[conductors.<name>.claude]` only carry `config_dir` and `env_file`. Setting `[claude] auto_mode = true` globally would put **every** Claude session on the host into auto mode — too broad for a per-repo legate.

To scope auto mode to legate's own conductor + its workers without affecting unrelated sessions, mini-legate uses agent-deck's per-session `extra-args` mechanism, which persists CLI flags on the Instance and re-applies them on every start/restart:

- **Conductor** — `march legate init` runs, after `agent-deck conductor setup`:
  ```
  agent-deck -p <profile> session set conductor-legate-<slug> auto-mode true
  agent-deck -p <profile> session restart conductor-legate-<slug>
  ```
  This flips `ClaudeOptions.AutoMode` on the conductor's Instance — agent-deck's launcher then emits `--permission-mode auto` on every start/restart. No operator action required; this is part of the deploy. (We use the direct `auto-mode` field rather than `extra-args -- --permission-mode auto` so a future inspection via `agent-deck session show` reports auto mode as a structured field rather than an opaque token list, and to avoid a misleading agent-deck CLI success-message bug that prints only the first positional arg.)

- **Workers** — the conductor's CLAUDE.md tells legate to include `--extra-arg --permission-mode --extra-arg auto` on every `agent-deck launch` for a worker. There is no per-launch `--auto-mode` flag on `agent-deck launch`, so workers go through the extra-args path; agent-deck stores those tokens on `Instance.ExtraArgs` and re-applies them on restart, so the flag survives session lifecycle events.

agent-deck exposes three claude permission keys / flags with a fixed precedence (`userconfig.go`):

| Key / extra-arg                       | Maps to                                    | Use it when                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--permission-mode auto`              | classifier auto-approval                   | **Default for mini-legate.** Routine ops auto-approve.            |
| `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`| opt-in to yolo via `/dangerous` mid-session| When the operator wants to flip on yolo manually for one session. |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions`      | yolo (overrides auto)                      | Escape valve for a slice that keeps stalling on auto mode.        |

Mini-legate prefers auto mode everywhere. The conductor escalates via a `NEED:` note when it hits a permission prompt rather than reaching for `dangerous_mode` — the auto classifier surfacing an approval prompt is itself a signal that the action deserves operator review.

If the conductor or a worker is missing the `--permission-mode auto` extra-arg (e.g. operator manually cleared it), the conductor will escalate on its first heartbeat after detection rather than silently stalling.

## Boundaries — what mini-legate will not do

- **No cross-repo work.** A conductor manages exactly one repo. The operator runs `march legate init` per repo; each gets its own conductor name (`legate-<slug>`) so they coexist in agent-deck's system-wide conductor namespace.
- **No autonomous merges.** Merging a PR is the operator's call; the conductor's role ends at "PR is green and reviewed".
- **No worktree cleanup.** Worktrees created by `--worktree -b` accumulate on disk after merges. Brood (M3) will own this; until then, the operator reclaims disk manually.
- **No force-pushes, no resets, no destructive git ops.** If `git pull --ff-only origin <default>` fails, the conductor escalates instead of forcing.
- **No re-planning of operator-approved slices** without explicit operator instruction.

## Future work that this precursor explicitly omits

- **Sandboxing** — workers run in real worktrees on the operator's host. Spawn (M1) will move them into restricted Docker containers.
- **Profile-driven security posture** — Hatchery (M2) will let different roles get different permissions; today everything is operator-trust.
- **Lifecycle management** — Brood (M3) will own worktree/branch/container cleanup at slice end.
- **Event-driven coordination** — Herald (M4) will push spawn-completion / CI / review events through a deterministic bus instead of relying on agent-deck heartbeats and `gh` polling.
- **Cross-issue dispatch** — "fix issue #123" → look up the GitHub issue, dispatch a worker — is a feature being tracked separately, not part of this precursor.

When those components ship, the conductor's interface will change (the launch command, the wait mechanism, the worker-state model) but the slice state machine drawn above should remain stable.
